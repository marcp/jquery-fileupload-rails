## Installing Gem
```ruby
gem 'jquery-fileupload-rails', github: 'futhr/jquery-fileupload-rails'
```

**NOTE:** _This gem's upstream has not been maintained for long time so its recommended to fork above branch until it been merged._

## Using the javascripts

Require jquery-fileupload in your app/assets/application.js file.

    //= require jquery-fileupload

The snippet above will add the following js files to the mainfest file.

    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/jquery.ui.widget
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/load-image
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/canvas-to-blob
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/tmpl
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.iframe-transport
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-process
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-image
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-audio
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-video
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-validate
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-ui
    //=require jquery-fileupload/locale

If you only need the basic files, just add the code below to your application.js file. [Basic setup guide][3]

    //= require jquery-fileupload/basic

The basic setup only includes the following files:

    //= require jquery-fileupload/vendor/jquery.ui.widget
    //= require jquery-fileupload/jquery.iframe-transport
    //= require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload

## Using the stylesheet

Require the stylesheet file to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

    *= require jquery.fileupload-ui

Additionally you can add support files:

    *= require jquery.fileupload-ui-noscript
    *= require jquery.fileupload-noscript
    *= require jquery.fileupload

## Using the middleware

The `jquery.iframe-transport` fallback transport has some special caveats regarding the response data type, http status, and character encodings. `jquery-fileupload-rails` includes a middleware that handles these inconsistencies seamlessly. If you decide to use it, create an initializer that adds the middleware to your application's middleware stack.
```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use JQuery::FileUpload::Rails::Middleware
```
